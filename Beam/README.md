# Beam code submission

## Instructions
Built with Xcode 10.2.1. Nothing special is required to build and run. There are no external dependencies, other than an active network connection to fetch the json.

## Notes
- This project follows the MVVM pattern. Coordinators were not used in the interest of expediency. 
- Source files are grouped by role: Views, Models, ViewModels, etc. In a larger, more complex project, these would additionally be grouped by modules within the app.
- The requirements stated that the alert for confirming deletion of a brushing record should have buttons labeled "Yes" and "No". I labeled these buttons "Delete" and "Cancel", as button text should be verbs describing the action they trigger.
