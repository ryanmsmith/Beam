# Beam Mobile App Exercise
Here at Beam, we provide our members with a Beam app to perform member functions, view their brushing details, and access their insurance card.

In this kata, you will be providing a member with their very own Beam app! From within the app, they will be able to view their member info, and add_update_delete/view brushing data.

## Getting Started

### Expectations
#### Language/Framework
We expect the following technologies to be used as a baseline:
* iOS: Latest version of Xcode, Swift, and iOS SDK
* Target build and testing for iPhone Xs Simulator
* Android: Latest Released API Version, Java or Kotlin
* Target build and testing for Android Simulator 28.0.25 with Pixel 2 skin

**Please include instructions detailing how to run your submission in the README.**

#### UI/UX Design
You may have noticed: there is no mockup or prototype provided. You have free rein in the UI/UX Design of this exercise!

That's not to say we expect you to be a UI/UX Designer. At a minimum, we're just expecting to see tasteful alignment and use of the branding assets included.

#### Testing
Please include tests with your submission. **Instructions for running your tests should be included in the README.**

## Submitting your work to Beam
Once you're happy with your submission, you can send it back in one of two formats; either as a git bundle or a zip file.

To create the git bundle simply execute:

```bash
cd beam-mobile-exercise
git bundle create beam-mobile-exercise.bundle <YOUR BRANCH NAME HERE>
```

This will create a `.bundle` file which contains the entire git repository in binary form, so you can easily send it as an attachment.  Alternately, you can zip the project instead.

### Getting the Member Data
For this exercise, you'll be displaying the data for a member named "Remy LeBeau". We've gone ahead and searched for his name in the system. You can find the results at [https://member-data.beam.dental/searchResults.json](https://member-data.beam.dental/searchResults.json). Note: in a production scenario we would have a RESTful API to query data from... For this exercise, we have just posted a static JSON file for download.

Unfortunately, his data has gotten a little messed up. There are some invalid records that you'll need to sort through to get his current data. The valid member record for Remy:
* Does not have a `primary_insured_id`. (He's his own primary insured.)
* Does not have a `terminated_at` date. (He still has insurance active.)
* Has the most recent `effective_date`. (Older ones might not be attached to the correct data anymore.)
